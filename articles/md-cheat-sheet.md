# Anthony's Blog Markdown Cheat Sheet

![Image](./blog-images/milo.jpg)

ok so the formatting I can use in these posts in pretty limited so this post serves as an exhaustive list of the things I can do. The following covers mostly the basic syntax, and maybe some additional things.

&nbsp;

---

## **Headings**

I only have access to h1 and h2. That's it.

# This is Heading 1
> `# This is Heading 1`
 

## This is Heading 2
> `## This is Heading 2`

&nbsp;

### This is Heading 3 ... wait a second
> `### This is Heading 3 ... wait a second`

&nbsp;

## **Line Breaks**
Generally, you want to leave two whitespaces at the end of a line if you want to create a new line.  

Alternatively, you can use the non-breaking space character: `&nbsp;` followed by an empty new line

&nbsp;

this is the first line  
&nbsp;

this is the second line

> ```
> this is the first line  
> &nbsp;
>
> this is the second line
> ```

&nbsp;

## **Emphasis**

There are two ways to add emphasis to words: **Bold** and *Italic*  

 - `*Italic*` text is sorrounded by a single pair of asterisks
 - `**Bold**` text is sorrounded by a souble pair of asterisks  

&nbsp;

You can also emphasize sections of text using:
> Blockquotes

- `> Blockquotes` are lines that begin with the right facing chevron
> "Wow I never new that ^ or < or > were called 'chevrons' " - _Me, right now_

&nbsp;

you can also create multi-line blockquotes:
> multi-line
> 
> blockquotes

```
> multi-line
> 
> blockquotes
```

&nbsp;

---

## **Lists**

you can create numbered or unordered lists:
1. first 
2. second
3. third

> ```
> 1. first 
> 2. second
> 3. third
> ```

&nbsp;

- this
- is
- unordered 

> ```
> - this 
> - is
> - unordered
> ```

I'll be adding more, but for now I'll leave this here for reference
