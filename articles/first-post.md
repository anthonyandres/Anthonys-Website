# Good to be here

![Chiitan and I](./blog-images/chiitan.png)  

Alright, I'm currently sitting here at my computer writing this and I have no clue what to put. For now, welcome to my blog I guess.

## What's going on

So, I'm still figuring out the capabilities of this implementation of the blog (can't use html, refreshing the page breaks the images, I can't use extended syntax, and I can only use headers h1 and h2 **huhhhh**), but it's simple enough and all I need to do to add a new post is just create a new markdown file.  

I've always wanted to have a place to just write about stuff I find interesting in the moment so I'll be putting a mix of random stuff here from time to time. Thankfully, all of the posts get organized by category and ordered by date so it's nice and easy to navigate.  

I plan on posting music stuff, photo stuff, references to things, and whatever works on this fairly bare bones format.
